> Lopri ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
> The author fixed my problem with the plugin very fast. With default sort order enabled, featured products are displayed first, as intended.<br> It would be nice to have the option (checkboxes?) to display featured products first with other sort orders, too. And maybe in product search results.
